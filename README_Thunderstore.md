# GKAPI

A modding API for [Gatekeeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2106670/Gatekeeper/) (Unity Game by Gravity Lagoon) <br>
The modding framework used is BepInEx, which is required to use this mod and mods using this.

## Usage

## For Players

This mod is just needed for mods building upon it. It doesn't add content on its own. I should be installed automatically if related mods need it.

## For Modders
